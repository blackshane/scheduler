# scheduler

## Prerequisites
    This program does not require prerequisites. It is a webpage available for all to view. 

## Description
    This application is used to save reminders to a schedule with typical business hours. The application also displays the current date and time, and changes the background color of each hour's block. Future blocks are turned green, the current time block will display in red, and past time blocks will appear gray.

  ## Deployment
    Open "Index.html" in a browser window.

## Challenges faced
 Challenges faced include getting the parsed data from local storage to appear on the page in its correct schedule time box. I was able to console.log the data in the console but it took some time to get the data to appear in the correct textarea based on its ID.
